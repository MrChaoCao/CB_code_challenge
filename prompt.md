We're going to start the interview with a take-home project - please complete in your own time:

Using Ruby & Sinatra, take a person's bank statement descriptors (can obtain fake transactions via OAuth at Plaid.com), extract the domains and process them through Clearbit. List each of transactions by date descending, and indicate whether that transaction is recurring (i.e. a subscription) or not. It would be great to see some tests.
 
* Use Plaid to pull statement descriptors (descriptions of the transaction)
* Use Clearbit to pull Company information from those transactions (e.g. Sightglass Coffee vs.Comcast, with company domains and relevant information)
* Display both the transactions and the related company data together - Indicate recurring payments
 
Let me know if you have any questions. Otherwise, we will look forward to seeing how you tackle this.
